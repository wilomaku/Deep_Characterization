# Deep_Characterization

In this repository, a method for characterization of the corpus callosum (CC) using a autoencoder (AE) is proposed. CC is associated with very important diseases and its characterization is an step to understand how these disease change its form, volume and structure. It will be studied several autoencoder models to grasp the diffusion information presented in the DWI volumes.
